- PureC unit test, fix issues compiling with C standard
- for pure virtual types create constructor that throws exception
- clang import to never use system version
- inheritance support for InPlace types (vtable pointer)
- unit test output or in-test value verification + throw
- fix extra -I on clang_index.parse() for clang 3.8.0 includes
- file issue re: FabricEDK.h and Pure C
- what does 'require Fabric;' do?
