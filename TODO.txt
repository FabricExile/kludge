- PureC unit test, fix issues compiling with C standard
- for pure virtual types create constructor that throws exception
- clang import to never use system version
- inheritance support for InPlace types (vtable pointer)
- unit test output or in-test value verification + throw
- fix extra -I on clang_index.parse() for clang 3.8.0 includes
- file issue re: FabricEDK.h and Pure C
- what does 'require Fabric;' do?
- exception handling, or exception-like (USD) handling
- code duplication for params between Function, Constructor, InstanceMethod
- uncomment typedef in Namespaces.hpp
- fix very ambiguous object ownership in types/wrapped_ptr/conv/lib_to_edk.cpp
- need to make header ordering unimportant
- no default constructor created if have other constructors, need empty constructor that throws KL exception or someting like that

--
X fix Inheritance with abstract return value
X missing namespace for 'new 's in fabric example
X must always defined default constructor (take away InlineType::InlineType() to see crash in test.kl)
