- PureC unit test, fix issues compiling with C standard
- clang import to never use system version
- inheritance support for InPlace types (vtable pointer)
- unit test output or in-test value verification + throw
- fix extra -I on clang_index.parse() for clang 3.8.0 includes
- file issue re: FabricEDK.h and Pure C
- exception handling, or exception-like (USD) handling
- fix very ambiguous object ownership in types/wrapped_ptr/conv/lib_to_edk.cpp
- need to make header ordering unimportant
- don't parse other headers in two places, either top-level or on-demand not both
- find and fix all FIXME hacks
- add support for all operator types (+/*/etc.)
- how to handle forward declarations
- fix template namespace issues (Template.hpp -> MyspaceType1)
- return values as refs/pointers should never create a new object

Namespaces:
- namespace issues with templated types (Foo<Bar>: Bar has wrong namespace)
- uncomment typedef in Namespaces.hpp

X fix Inheritance with abstract return value
X missing namespace for 'new 's in fabric example
X must always defined default constructor (take away InlineType::InlineType() to see crash in test.kl)
X what does 'require Fabric;' do?
X no default constructor created if have other constructors, need empty constructor that throws KL exception or someting like that
X possible handling for function default values (make multiple KL functions)
X for abstract types create constructor that throws exception
X code duplication for params between Function, Constructor, InstanceMethod
X aliases created multiple times in .kl file
X consolidate template handling code
